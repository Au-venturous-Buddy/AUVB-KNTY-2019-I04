<h3>Pomegranate Lemonade and Mint Lemonade</h3>
Last but not the least, there are the drinks. At Falafel Yo!, they serve two lemonade flavors: Pomegranate Lemonade and Mint Lemonade. The Pomegranate Lemonade is not your ordinary pink lemonade; it is a perfect blend of the sweetness of the pomegranate and the sourness of the lemonade. On the other hand, the Mint Lemonade is very refreshing (although, for me, it seems that the mint overpowered the lemonade by some degree, but my parents liked it! ðŸ™‚).

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Without a doubt, Falafel Yo! is a one-of-a-kind in the Philippine food scene. The Falafel Pitas are very delicious, brimming with flavors and fresh ingredients, the pita fries look very palatable, soft, and not very crunchy, and the lemonades are really refreshing! If you really want to try something new, look no further than Falafel Yo! ðŸ™‚
