<h2>Our Picks</h2>

<h3>Pita Fries</h3>
First in the list are Falafel Yo!'s Pita Fries, which is a very healthy option since it makes use of pita slices instead of the fatty potato french fries, and comes tossed with any of the following flavors: cheese, sour cream, or Za'atar (which is a Mediterranean herb blend). We tried the latter two. The Pita Fries with the Za'atar tastes very earthy, while the Pita Fries with the Sour Cream tastes very creamy and heavenly! Either way, the pita fries are very soft yet not too crunchy! What's more, it comes free if you order both a Falafel Pita and a drink! ðŸ™‚
