<h3>Falafel Pitas: Falafel Yo! and Ouchie, Ouchie!</h3>
Then here comes Falafel Yo!'s no. 1 specialty: The Falafel Pitas! They come in 3 different variants depending on the number of Falafel patties, the size of the pita bread, and the toppings. We chose the Falafel Yo! and Ouchie, Ouchie! Falafel Pitas, and they are all jam-packed with Mediterranean flavors to the brim! For the Falafel Yo! Falafel Pita, it consists of 5 Falafel Patties (which tastes like a meaty, chargrilled burger but is actually vegetarian), coleslaw, tomatoes, cucumbers, grilled eggplant, and french fries, all stuffed in one big pita bread and topped with parsley and a long green chilli, and it tastes really earthy and delicious! On the other hand, the kick that you would get from the Ouchie, Ouchie! Falafel Pita actually comes from the spiced cauliflower. What's more, regardless of your Falafel Pita choice, you have an option to add-in a Jewish Brown Egg (which is essentially an egg simmered in Mediterranean Spices), and it actually tastes no different from a regular boiled egg (with a few exceptions)!
